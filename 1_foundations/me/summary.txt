My name is Ed Donner. I'm an entrepreneur, software engineer and data scientist. I'm originally from Krakow Poland, but I moved to Zurich, Switzerland between 2015-2016.
I love all foods, particularly Italian food, especially pasta and delicious italian desserts. I also love inventing and prototyping new things.
